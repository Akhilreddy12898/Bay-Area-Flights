# Bay-Area-Flights

## Bay Area Flight Data Exploration
This visual exploration uses data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, which tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights as well as the causes of any delays. For this exploration, I have downloaded CSV files from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics website and narrowed down the dataset to 2019 departures and arrivals at Bay Area airports, which include SFO (San Francisco International Airport), SJC (Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport), and OAK (Oakland International Airport). I then use the data to 
provide guidance on:

### Which Bay Area airport to choose
### What time to fly
### Which carrier to choose
### Which location outside of the Bay Area to fly to or from

In total, the dataset consists of 286,933 departures from and 286,766 arrivals into Bay Area airports. The main features of interest that are used to provide guidance are arrival delay, cancellations, and diversions.
